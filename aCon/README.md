# aCon
Runescape 3 bot to automate construction.

This bot works with assuming you have the full constructor's elite skilling outfit so that it can auto remove built items (VERY CONVENIENT). All this bot does is click on the hotspot to build flotsam prawnbrokers with protean planks. Using protean planks allows you to stack planks rather than needing your butlter to bank and retrieve them for you.
