# klique
 Originally an auto clicker that included random mouse movements within a certain area (aka jitter clicking [jKlique]). Added 2 more .cpp files to expand on this project
  Includes Old School Runescape fletching bot, Runescape 3 clockwork bot, and a Runescape 3 2 tick Divination bot.
	Fletching bot is intended to create darts VERY quickly
	The RS3 clockwork bot clicks to pick up clockworks for Agility XP. It's not intended to wind them up and drop them with keybinds because the amount of XP needed wasn't enough to add that into the code at the time of creating it.
	The RS3 2t Divination bot is intended to be paired with the 'core hunting' fc. This bot will take the initial position that is saved to click every 2 ticks in game for slighly quicker XP. Even though the XP is very slight, it was still fun to keep creating bots with similar functions to further increase my understanding in C++.
