 Old School Runescape construction bot. Ended up not finishing this yet but was able to make a color aimbot work properly. May revisit this?
 This program is probably the most advanced one I have worked on. In order for this to work without injecting/hooking into the game, the program required using a colored aimbot to find the butler to collect planks and ask the butler to go to the bank to grab more. This was done by creating a uniquely colored highlight to the NPC via either the OpenOSRS or RuneLite clients. The colored aimbot was taken from an external source which I was successfully able to get it to work on clicking the butler. However, other issues arrised due to being an external bot and not having access to many (MAAAANY) conveniences such as player position, player status, npc position and id, item id, etc. This may get revisited but most likely not due to me learning Java and being able to hook into the game and create bots infinitely easier.
