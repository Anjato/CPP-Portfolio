#  roboCraft
Old School Runescape crafting bot. 
This bot was initially intended to create black d'hide bodies in the dual arena bank but can very easily be modified to craft other items as well. You would just need to change the keys pressed when crafting an item as well as wait times due to inventories taking varied times to complete.
