# StdDeviationTest
Test environment for standard deviation.

Never finished this due to the complexity of implementing it in bots and it's simply unncessary for the case I would be using it in. Using random sleep intervals proved to work just as well, only need 1 small line of code and still gives enough variability in clicks to where it's not easily caught immediately by heuristics Jagex uses for bot detection.
