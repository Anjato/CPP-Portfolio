# aCraft
Runescape 3 bot to automate crafting.

This bot was used to cut any sort of gems your heart desires in game. All this does is use keybinds to open a preloaded inventory, cut gems, and a mouse click to open the bank interface in Lumbridge. You need to click on a portable crafter FIRST and craft gems that way to get the XP boost. After the first time, it should provide the boost (if within 1 square of your character) until you log out.
